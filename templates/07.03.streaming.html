            <li>
                <strong>Spotify:</strong> Use a premium account if possible. Avoid using bots or repetitive loops, as these can get flagged. Instead, create natural playlists and include their songs multiple times.

            <li>
                <strong>YouTube:</strong> Watch official music videos from their verified channels. Do not skip ads, and avoid using playlists for repetitive streaming.
