                <li>
                    <strong>Spotify:</strong> Use a premium account if possible. Avoid using bots or repetitive loops, as these can get flagged. Instead, create natural playlists and include their songs multiple times.

                <li>
                    <strong>Apple Music:</strong> Ensure you have a subscription, as streams from paid accounts are given more weight on charts.

                <li>
                    <strong>SoundCloud:</strong> Engage with their uploads by liking, commenting, and sharing the tracks.
