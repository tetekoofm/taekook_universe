      </div>

      <p>Born on <strong>September 1, 1997</strong>, in <strong>Busan</strong>, South Korea, Jeon Jungkook was a quiet and curious child. He graduated from Seoul’s School of  Performing Arts in 2017. He received his college degree in  Broadcasting and Entertainment in 2022. He grew up with a deep love for drawing, gaming, and sports — never quite imagining he’d one day stand on the world’s biggest stages.</p>
      <div class="quote-box" data-aos="zoom-in">
        “Respect, Understanding, Consideration. A person should always have these three.” — JK
      </div>
      <p>In 2011, he auditioned for <strong>Superstar K</strong> at just 13 years old. Though he didn’t make it to the finals, his talent caught the eye of multiple entertainment companies but, he chose Big Hit because of RM. Jungkook trained hard — undergoing dance training in LA, mastering vocals, and growing through every stage of practice. When BTS debuted in 2013, he was just 15 but, his energy, voice, and sharp gaze made him unforgettable. From a shy boy who barely spoke to the group’s “Golden Maknae,” Jungkook’s transformation was as inspiring as it was beautiful. Every stage, every note, every step — he gave his all.

    <p>Behind the spotlight, he’s a quiet creator who sees beauty in small moments and turns them into art. His music videos reflect his vision, with visuals that deepen the stories he tells. Through his role in BTS’s creative work, he’s become an artist who not only performs but also builds the narratives behind each piece. His Golden Closet Films, also known as GCF, are not simple travel videos. They are memories, carefully shaped with emotion and attention. Every frame, from the angle of the shot to the choice of color, carries meaning and intention.</p> 
    <p>He has a deep love for painting, using it as another way to express his feelings. He finds comfort in cooking for the people he cares about. In one of his many live streams, he cooked perilla oil makguksu and shared his recipe, which went viral! His passion for cooking even led him to choose the role of a chef during his military service. He doesn’t just express; he leaves pieces of his heart in everything he does.</p>
