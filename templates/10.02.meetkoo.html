      </div>

      <p>Born on <strong>September 1, 1997</strong>, in <strong>Busan</strong>, South Korea, Jeon Jungkook was a quiet and curious child. He graduated from Seoul’s School of  Performing Arts in 2017. He received his college degree in  Broadcasting and Entertainment in 2022. He grew up with a deep love for drawing, gaming, and sports — never quite imagining he’d one day stand on the world’s biggest stages.</p>
      <div class="quote-box" data-aos="zoom-in">
        “Respect, Understanding, Consideration. A person should always have these three.” — JK
      </div>
      <p>In 2011, he auditioned for <strong>Superstar K</strong> at just 13 years old. Though he didn’t make it to the finals, his talent caught the eye of multiple entertainment companies but, he chose Big Hit because of RM. Jungkook trained hard — undergoing dance training in LA, mastering vocals, and growing through every stage of practice. When BTS debuted in 2013, he was just 15 but, his energy, voice, and sharp gaze made him unforgettable. From a shy boy who barely spoke to the group’s “Golden Maknae,” Jungkook’s transformation was as inspiring as it was beautiful. Every stage, every note, every step — he gave his all.

    <h2 class="chapter-title">💌 TaeTae’s Whispers</h2>
  
    <p>Taehyung speaks with his fans, listens to them, and comforts them like a friend. He appears spontaneously when he misses them either through his Instagram posts or a very short Weverse Lives or through his replies to fan posts. He creates a space that feels personal, safe, and full of love. He has the record of doing the 8 second short live where he just came to say "Hi" to his fans.</p>

    <p>During his live, he asks fans how their day went, plays music, reads comments out loud, and even shows Yeontan curled up beside him. Taehyung being just Taehyung. In his replies to ARMY, he’s witty, playful, and thoughtful. When fans express sadness or insecurity, he gently reminds them of their worth. When they joke, he laughs along. Through the screen, he turns a million voices into a quiet, honest conversation.</p>

    <p>In response to a fan's letter about Layover Anniversary project, he responded, "Hmm I was running in front of the military camp & I saw the pictures and I blushed from seeing it.</p>
