            <p>
                <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> — a film deeply supported by Taehyung — is a coming-of-age story centered on love and identity. 
                Taehyung referenced it multiple times between 2019 and 2024, including piano performances, livestream shoutouts, and a Harper’s Bazaar shoot inspired by its palette.

            <p>
                While not specifically named, it is widely accepted that Jungkook has shown his support for the movie by referencing its most famous line, <strong>“I am still me…”</strong> from the film, <em>Love, Simon</em> on more than one occasion.
                <em>Love, Simon</em>, released in 2018, is a coming-of-age film about a gay high school student, Simon, who is navigating the process of coming out and finding love. 
                The movie explores themes of self-discovery, acceptance, and the struggles faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in high school.

            <p>
                The iconic dancing scene by Leslie Cheung from the 1990 film <em>Days of Being Wild</em> has been shared and replicated by Taehyung — and even Jungkook — on multiple occasions, including a video Tae shared from his home.
                Before his tragic death in 2003 due to severe depression, Leslie Cheung was a beloved Hong Kong actor and singer, and one of the first public figures in the Chinese-speaking world to come out and openly support LGBTQ+ rights.
                His partner, Daffy Tong, continues to honor him with heartfelt posts on Instagram during their birthdays and on the anniversary of his passing — even after more than 18 years.

            <h3>🌈 Taehyung’s Support for the 2024 Film <em>Queer</em></h3>
            <p>
                Most recently, Taehyung has shown his support for the 2024 movie <em>Queer</em> by liking multiple Instagram posts announcing its release. 
                The movie <em>Queer</em>, based on William S. Burroughs' semi-autobiographical novella, follows William Lee, a disillusioned American expatriate in 1950s Mexico City, as he pursues connection and meaning through his relationship with Eugene Allerton. 
                Lee, a drug-addicted man, becomes infatuated with the young and seemingly aloof Allerton, leading to a complex and ultimately surreal journey.
