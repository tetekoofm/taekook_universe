            <h3>🌈 Taehyung and Jungkook’s Support for LGBTQ+ Themed Films</h3>
            
            <p>
                Taehyung has been a vocal supporter of the film, <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>, an Academy Award–nominated film from 2017, based on a 2007 coming-of-age novel by André Aciman. 
                Set in the 1980s, it centers on the sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between student Elio and American scholar Oliver, chronicling their relationship and the 20 years that follow.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Tae first mentioned the movie in May of 2019. He dramatically performed part of a piano piece, “Le Jardin Féerique from Ma Mère l’Oye” by Szervánszky & Cavaye, from the movie’s OST.
                A few weeks later in June, he mentioned his love for the movie during a live broadcast with J-Hope. A year later in June of 2020, he recited some lines from the movie during another live broadcast. 
                In this scene, Mr. Perlman delivers a powerful speech to Elio. As recent as 2024, the film continues to inspire Taehyung, as seen in his photo shoot with <em>Harper’s Bazaar Korea</em>, the colors of which were inspired by the movie.

                <em>Love, Simon</em>, released in 2018, is a coming-of-age film about a gay high school student, Simon, who is navigating the process of coming out and finding love. 
                The movie explores themes of self-discovery, acceptance, and the struggles faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in high school.

                The iconic dancing scene by Leslie Cheung from the 1990 film <em>Days of Being Wild</em> has been shared and replicated by Taehyung — and even Jungkook — on multiple occasions, including a video Tae shared from his home.
                Before his tragic death in 2003 due to severe depression, Leslie Cheung was a beloved Hong Kong actor and singer, and one of the first public figures in the Chinese-speaking world to come out and openly support LGBTQ+ rights.
                His partner, Daffy Tong, continues to honor him with heartfelt posts on Instagram during their birthdays and on the anniversary of his passing — even after more than 18 years.

                Most recently, Taehyung has shown his support for the 2024 movie <em>Queer</em> by liking multiple Instagram posts announcing its release. 
                The movie <em>Queer</em>, based on William S. Burroughs' semi-autobiographical novella, follows William Lee, a disillusioned American expatriate in 1950s Mexico City, as he pursues connection and meaning through his relationship with Eugene Allerton. 
                Lee, a drug-addicted man, becomes infatuated with the young and seemingly aloof Allerton, leading to a complex and ultimately surreal journey.

                While curating his <strong>‘Flower Buddies’</strong> brooch, Taehyung drew a thoughtful comparison to the works of iconic pop artist <strong>Andy Warhol</strong>. Warhol, a queer art legend, was known for transforming everyday symbols into vibrant cultural statements. 
                Taehyung’s brooches echo Warhol’s spirit—playful, emotional, and symbolic—bringing together art, identity, and sentiment.
