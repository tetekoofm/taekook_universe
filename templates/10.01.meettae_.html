      <p>Born on <strong>December 30, 1995</strong>, in <strong>Daegu</strong>, South Korea, Kim Taehyung was raised in a loving family with strong values. As the eldest of three children, he grew up under the warmth of his grandparents, who played a pivotal role in shaping his early life. He graduated from Korean Arts High School in 2014. He also received his degree in Broadcasting and Entertainment from the Global Cyber University in 2020. Tae has shown his love for music from a young age. He picked up the saxophone in middle school and fell in love with the way it made him feel.</p>

      <p>Taehyung auditioned for Big Hit in 2011, purely by chance. He was only accompanying a friend. A staff member encouraged him to try out, and he ended up becoming a trainee. While other members were introduced early, V remained a mystery to fans until the very day BTS debuted. His first appearance sparked curiosity and admiration. That deep voice! That gaze! That energy! He may have been the last surprise of the debut line-up, but he quickly proved himself as an irreplaceable piece of the BTS puzzle.</p>

      <p>Debuting with BTS on June 13, 2013, Taehyung immediately stood out with his deep baritone voice, rich stage charisma, and unconventional artistic sensibilities. As part of the vocal line, his unique tone brings texture and depth to BTS’s sound, whether it's the raw vulnerability of <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Spring Day</strong> or the sultry harmony of <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Boy With Luv</strong> or his brooding elegance in <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Black Swan</strong>, his parts often add emotional gravity to key moments in their discography.</p> 
      <p>Vocally, his harmonies and lower-register ad-libs form the emotional undercurrent of many BTS songs like <strong style="color: #00ffff;">The Truth Untold</strong> and <strong style="color: #00ffff;">00:00 (Zero O’Clock)</strong>. A standout moment of his vocal versatility is his signature growl in <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Jump</strong>, where his raw power and intensity add a dynamic layer to the track, showcasing his unique ability to shift between smooth, emotional delivery and explosive vocal energy.</p> 
      <p>Beyond his vocal role, V’s songwriting and conceptual influence have grown steadily. He received his first official writing credit on <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Hold Me Tight</strong> (2015), showing early promise as a composer. In 2017, he co-composed the soft, introspective track <strong style="color: #00ffff;">4 O’Clock</strong> with RM, a reflective piece released during BTS Festa, inspired by moments of solitude and companionship. He co-wrote and co-composed the introspective track <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Blue & Grey</strong> for the <em>BE</em> album, originally intended for his solo project. The song captured themes of burnout, anxiety, and quiet yearning, striking a chord with listeners worldwide.</p>
      <p>On stage, his performance style blends elegance and instinct, adding drama and dimension to every show. V remains one of BTS’s most enigmatic yet grounding forces—quietly shaping the group’s sound and soul.</p>
      <p>V’s creative eye is evident in the group’s visual projects as well. He contributed to the artistic direction of various photo concepts and was closely involved in curating the mood and visuals of BTS’s exhibitions. In every era, his input—musical, aesthetic, and emotional—has quietly shaped BTS’s evolution.</p>

      <p>Outside BTS, V has steadily carved out a unique space as a solo artist within and beyond the group’s discography. His first solo track with BTS was <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Stigma</strong> from the “WINGS” album (2016), a jazz-tinged ballad showcasing his deep register and emotional nuance, foreshadowing his evolving artistic voice.</p>
      <p>In 2018, he unveiled <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Singularity</strong>, the opener for “Love Yourself: Tear.” With hypnotic choreography and a neo-soul soundscape, the track earned critical acclaim, landing on the New York Times’ “65 Best Songs of 2018.” His haunting delivery became central to BTS’s artistic identity at the time.</p>
      <p>V began sharing independent work in 2019 with <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Scenery</strong>, a self-composed acoustic ballad paired with nostalgic visuals. It broke SoundCloud streaming records and introduced fans to his cinematic storytelling. That same year, he released <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Winter Bear</strong>, his first all-English track and self-directed video—revealing his introspective lyricism and visual artistry.</p>
      <p>His OST journey began with <strong style="color: #00ffff;">It’s Definitely You</strong>, a 2016 duet with Jin for the drama <em>Hwarang</em>, where his warm vocals contrasted vibrant instrumentation. In 2020, he dropped <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Sweet Night</strong> for <em>Itaewon Class</em>, debuting at #2 on Billboard’s U.S. Digital Song Sales and gaining global OST recognition. That Christmas, <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Snow Flower</strong> (feat. Peakboy) brought comfort during the pandemic. He closed 2021 with <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Christmas Tree</strong>, a gentle ballad that entered the Billboard Hot 100 and resonated for its intimacy.</p>
      <p>In 2023, V released <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Wherever U R</strong> with UMI, a tender fan-dedicated track gifted on his birthday before enlistment. Its lo-fi R&B sound and bilingual lyrics conveyed warmth and quiet affection. In 2024, he returned with <strong style="color: #00ffff;">FRI(END)S</strong>, a soulful, conversational single that debuted at No. 65 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaked at No. 3 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart, and topped iTunes in 102 countries—affirming his global reach. That winter, he offered <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Winter Ahead</strong> (with Park Hyoshin), a soft, jazz-leaning ballad steeped in seasonal nostalgia. He also fulfilled a dream by collaborating posthumously with his idol Bing Crosby on <strong style="color: #00ffff;">White Christmas</strong>, merging vintage holiday charm with his own warm tone in a timeless tribute.</p>

His photos are quiet, thoughtful reflections of how he sees the world — tender, detailed, and deeply emotional.</p>
      <p>He also enjoys video games, where he relaxes, explores, and shares small moments with fans in his own quiet way. For Taehyung, art isn’t just a hobby, but a reflection of his inner self. He doesn’t just create; he curates meaningful experiences.</p>

      <p>V released his first solo album, <strong>“Layover”</strong> on September 8, 2023.</p>
      <p>Layover consists of six tracks in total - five tracks and a bonus track. From soulful ballads to sleek R&B rhythms, Layover captures V’s introspective journey. To fully appreciate the album's flow, Taehyung recommends listening to it in sequence from start to finish.</p>

      <p>The entire album felt like a letter to the fans. During promotions, he appeared on variety shows charming audiences with his natural charisma. Taehyung stepped out of his comfort zone, quite literally, by donning a teddy bear costume and taking to the streets. Disguised and anonymous, he sought unfiltered reactions to his music, free from the influence of fame. The playful stunt revealed his sincere desire to connect through art on a purely human level, letting the music speak before the name. From Tiny Desk Korea to First Take, he proved that V, the artist was just as magnetic as V the idol. With each movement, each look, he reminded the world: he isn’t just singing the music. He *is* the music.</p>
      
      <p>Some of the achievements the album received are:
      <ul>
        <li>The highest first day sales first-day sales of any solo album in Hanteo history, at $2,101,974 copies.</li>

      <p>Thank you, Taehyung, for being a light in the quiet moments and a comfort in the loud ones. Your warmth, sincerity, and timeless love for your fans create a place where we can always feel safe and seen.</p>     
      <p>You teach us that even the smallest gestures — a smile, a word, a song can hold immense healing. We love you endlessly, just as you are.</p>
