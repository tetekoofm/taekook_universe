        <h3>What Does Buying Music Mean?</h3>
        <p>Buying music refers to legally purchasing physical/digital copies of an album or single from authorized platforms or stores respectively. This increases the sales, thus helps with the artist's chart rankings.</p>

        <h3>How to Buy Music?</h3>
        <p>Follow these steps to ensure your purchase is counted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Choose the Right Platform:</strong> Purchase from official platforms like Weverse Shop, BTS Store, iTunes, Qobuz, Amazon, and Ktown4u.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Buy Individual Tracks & Albums:</strong> On digital platforms, buy individual songs first to maximize impact and then proceed to buy the album.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Avoid Bulk Purchases in One Go:</strong> Spread out your purchases using different accounts and payment methods instead of bulk-buying at once.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Use Different Platforms:</strong> Purchase from multiple platforms instead of focusing on just one.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Ensure Proper Payment:</strong> Use legitimate payment methods to avoid refunds or cancellations that could affect charting.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Download Immediately:</strong> After digital purchases, download the songs/albums immediately, to ensure the sale is counted. Also, delete them from your Library so your streams are counted.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Share & Recommend:</strong> Share the official buying links with friends and family to encourage them to purchase.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #3dcf64;">Join Buying Parties:</strong> If you are unsure, join the Buying Parties organized by our fanbases during the new release.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have listed down the Physical and Digital platforms from where we can buy their music. Please use them:</p>
