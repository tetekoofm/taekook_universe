    </div>

    <p>
      Born on <strong>December 30, 1995</strong>, in <strong>Daegu</strong>, South Korea, Kim Taehyung was raised in a loving family with strong values. As the eldest of three children, he grew up under the warmth of his grandparents, who played a pivotal role in shaping his early life. Though his surroundings were modest, Taehyung's imagination and spirit were anything but.
    </p>

    <p>
      Music called to him from a young age. He picked up the saxophone in middle school and fell in love with the way it made him feel ‚Äî expressive, free, and full of soul. With his father's encouragement, he auditioned for Big Hit Entertainment in 2011. He wasn't even supposed to audition that day ‚Äî he had only come to support a friend ‚Äî but a staff member encouraged him to try.
    </p>

    <p>
      That moment would change everything.
    </p>

    <div class="quote-box" data-aos="zoom-in">
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know I would become a singer. But I believed in myself when no one else did.‚Äù ‚Äî V
    </div>

    <p>
      Taehyung auditioned for Big Hit in 2011, purely by chance ‚Äî he was only accompanying a friend. A staff member encouraged him to try out, and he ended up becoming a trainee. He remained a hidden member until BTS‚Äôs official debut in June 2013. Taehyung officially became a Big Hit trainee in 2011, joining the company quietly. While other members were introduced early, V remained a mystery to fans until the very day BTS debuted ‚Äî June 13, 2013. His first appearance sparked curiosity and admiration. That deep voice. That gaze. That energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He may have been the last surprise of the debut line-up, but he quickly proved himself as an irreplaceable piece of the BTS puzzle.
