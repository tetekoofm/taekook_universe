      <p>Taehyung auditioned for Big Hit in 2011, purely by chance. He was only accompanying a friend. A staff member encouraged him to try out, and he ended up becoming a trainee. While other members were introduced early, V remained a mystery to fans until the very day BTS debuted. His first appearance sparked curiosity and admiration. That deep voice! That gaze! That energy! He may have been the last surprise of the debut line-up, but he quickly proved himself as an irreplaceable piece of the BTS puzzle.</p>
