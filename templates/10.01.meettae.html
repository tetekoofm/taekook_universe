      </div>

      <p>Born on <strong>December 30, 1995</strong>, in <strong>Daegu</strong>, South Korea, Kim Taehyung was raised in a loving family with strong values. As the eldest of three children, he grew up under the warmth of his grandparents, who played a pivotal role in shaping his early life. Though his surroundings were modest, Taehyung's imagination and spirit were anything but.</p>
      <p>Music called to him from a young age. He picked up the saxophone in middle school and fell in love with the way it made him feel — expressive, free, and full of soul. With his father's encouragement, he auditioned for Big Hit Entertainment in 2011. He wasn't even supposed to audition that day — he had only come to support a friend — but a staff member encouraged him to try.</p>
      <p>That moment would change everything.</p>

        “I didn’t know I would become a singer. But I believed in myself when no one else did.” — V
      </div>
    
      <p>Taehyung auditioned for Big Hit in 2011, purely by chance — he was only accompanying a friend. A staff member encouraged him to try out, and he ended up becoming a trainee. He remained a hidden member until BTS’s official debut in June 2013. Taehyung officially became a Big Hit trainee in 2011, joining the company quietly. While other members were introduced early, V remained a mystery to fans until the very day BTS debuted — June 13, 2013. His first appearance sparked curiosity and admiration. That deep voice. That gaze. That energy.</p>
      <p>He may have been the last surprise of the debut line-up, but he quickly proved himself as an irreplaceable piece of the BTS puzzle.</p>

      <h2 class="chapter-title">💜 V's Legacy: "I Purple You"</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">V is also credited with coining the phrase, “I purple you (Borahae)” in November 2016. Since then, purple has become synonymous with BTS and their fanbase. The phrase was also used by UNICEF for BTS’s anti-bullying collaboration.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">As a solo artist, he released his first self-composed song, ‘Scenery’ on January 30, 2019 via SoundCloud. It broke the daily streaming record nine times during its first two weeks of release. Seven months later, he released ‘Winter Bear’ on August 9, 2019, along with a self-directed music video published on BTS’s YouTube page.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">He followed those up with ‘Sweet Night’ in March 2020, a song he wrote and performed for the soundtrack of the JTBC drama ‘Itaewon Class.’ ‘Sweet Night’ debuted at number two on Billboard’s U.S. Digital Song sales chart, the highest debut for a K-soloist in the chart’s history. Then on December 25, 2020, he released another solo track, ‘Snow Flower’ featuring Peakboy. He released his third OST on December 21, 2021 with ‘Christmas Tree.’ It was written for the South Korean television series ‘Our Beloved Summer.’</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;">Taehyung is also well-known for his love of his late dog, Kim Yeontan, a pomeranian first introduced to fans in December 2017. Yeontan or "Tannie" was a huge part of Taehyung's life, and was cited as his muse for his debut album, ‘Layover.” His image graced the cover of the album, and he is featured in the music videos. V also used Yeontan’s image for the cover art for his collaboration with Bing Crosby, “White Christmas.” The music video also featured a cartoon Yeontan, ending in an image of Tannie in the stars. Taehyung later announced the passing of Yeontan in late 2024.</p>
